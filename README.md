# Customising Bootstrap with Sass Lesson Task

The video lesson converted the home, product and contact pages to Sass. 

For this task, convert those three pages plus the product detail and about pages.

Consult the [files from the lesson](https://github.com/NoroffFEU/customising-bootstrap-with-sass) if you get stuck.

There is an example answer on the [answer](https://github.com/NoroffFEU/customising-bootstrap-with-sass-lesson-task/tree/answer) branch of this repo.
